# Formalising Mathematics in Lean

This is the repository for the GlaMS course on Formalising Mathematics in Lean. The course content (workshop sheets and homeworks) is located in the folder `Formal2024`. There is also a `References` folder.

## Getting the weekly updates

Type the following in your terminal
```terminal
git pull && lake update -R && lake exe cache get
```

If you get an error with `lake update -R`, try `rm -rf .lake` then the above again.

## How to work on this

### Starting the repository

#### In Codespaces/Gitpod
The easy method: Use Lean in your very own web browser! <br>
This can be done using Codespaces:<br> [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/glams-lean-2024/formal-2024?quickstart=1) <br>
Or using Gitpod:<br> [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/glams-lean-2024/formal-2024)

#### Locally
Install Lean on your computer following these [instructions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).
Then you can clone this repository to your own computer by writing `git clone https://github.com/glams-lean-2024/formal-2024.git` in your terminal, followed by `lake exe cache get`.

### Working on the repository

All the files we will be using can be found in the folder `Formal2024`: this contains both the workshop and homework sheets.

In order to work on this efficiently, please make a copy of the folder and working on the copy rather than in the folder Formal2024. You can do this by writing `cp -r Formal2024 MyFiles` in your terminal. This copies the whole folder into a new folder called `MyFiles` which you will be working on (you can even create your own Lean files in that folder to experiment on!).

Each week, when the repository gets updated, you can type `git pull` in your terminal, then typing `lake update -R` to update all the dependencies, followed by `lake exe cache get`. This adds the new files into the folder `Formal2024`, which you can then copy manually into your own folder.

If you do work on the `Formal2024` folder, and get a merge conflict when pulling the repository, then you should type `git config pull --rebase false` before `git pull`, you probably would need to also `git add --all` and `git commit -m "some message"` before `git pull` if you do get a merge conflict.

### Troubleshooting in Codespaces/Gitpod

- after waiting ~5 minutes for the codespaces to run, you will want to restart any opened file (by doing `ctrl / command + shift + P`, then you search for something along the lines of `Lean4:restart file`)
- if it still doesn't work, then you `lake exe cache get` in your terminal
- if it still doesn't work, then you `lake update -R` in your terminal
- if you're still not progressing, please message on Discord `#general` under the `Lean` category
